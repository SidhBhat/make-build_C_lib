This Makefile builds static libraries from c files in any directory inside the directory specified by 'srcdir'.
The name of the library is the name of the directory consiting of the c files.
Each directory repesents a library.

The file "main.c" in 'Source directory' (srcdir), is used to create a executable linked with the built library to test it.

This would represent the structure:
==========
<current directory>
	|
	|-<srcdir>
	|	|-<directories (named after the name of library to build)>*
	|	|	|-<c files>*
	|	|
	|	|-<main.c>
	|
	|-<buildir>
	|	|-<directories (named after the name of library to build)>*
	|	|	|-<c object files>*
	|	|
	|	|-<static libraries files (named based on directories)>*
	|	|-<executable prog_name>
	|
	|-<Makefile>

note: * at the end signifies more than one.

To gain additional control over build proccess the following variables can be set from commandline:

#====Compiler flags====#
CC		(defualt 'gcc')
CLIBS		(defualt no value)
CFLAGS		(defualt '-g -O -Wall')
AR		(defualt 'ar')
ARFLAGS		(defualt 'crs')
#====Install configuration====#
prefix		(/usr/local)
DESTDIR		(defualt no value)
#====Program name====#
prog_name	(defualt 'main.out')
#====================#

The following variables are NOT meant to be set from commandline (they have other implications):
INSTALL
INTALL_PROGRAM
INSTALL_DATA
srcdir
buildir
...etc
